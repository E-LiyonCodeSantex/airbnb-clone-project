### 🤝 Importance of User-Friendly Design

A well-crafted UI/UX in a booking system ensures that users move from browsing to booking with minimal friction. Clear navigation, accessible layouts, responsive designs, and fast load times all enhance usability and increase conversion rates. Happy users are more likely to trust the platform, return in the future, and recommend it to others.
